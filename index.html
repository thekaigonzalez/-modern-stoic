    <h1>What is Stoicism?</h1>
    <p>Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that originated in Greece around the 3rd century BC. It teaches that the key to a good life is achieving inner tranquility and virtue by focusing on what we can control and accepting what we cannot."</p>

    <h1>Key principles of Stoicism</h1>
    <p>
<b>1.</b> Focus on the present moment: Embrace the "here and now" and let go of anxieties about the past or the future.
<br>

<b>2.</b> Acceptance of the inevitable: Acknowledge that some things are beyond our control, and instead, focus on how we respond to them.
<br>
<b>3.</b> Virtue is the highest good: Strive to cultivate virtues such as wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance, as they lead to a fulfilling life.
<br>
<b>4.</b> Practice self-discipline: Train yourself to avoid impulsive reactions and develop resilience in the face of challenges.
<br>
<b>5.</b> Embrace setbacks as opportunities: View obstacles as chances for growth and learning, rather than as setbacks.
<br>
<b>6.</b> Cultivate gratitude: Appreciate what you have and be content with it, rather than constantly seeking more.
<br>
<b>7.</b> Practice mindfulness: Observe your thoughts and emotions without judgment to gain better control over your reactions.</p>
