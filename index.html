      <h1>The <i>key</i> principles of Stoicism:</h1>

      <p>
        <b>1.</b> Focus on the present moment: Embrace the "here and now" and let go of anxieties about the past or the
        future.
        <br>

        <b>2.</b> Acceptance of the inevitable: Acknowledge that some things are beyond our control, and instead, focus
        on how we respond to them.
        <br>
        <b>3.</b> Virtue is the highest good: Strive to cultivate virtues such as wisdom, courage, justice, and
        temperance, as they lead to a fulfilling life.
        <br>
        <b>4.</b> Practice self-discipline: Train yourself to avoid impulsive reactions and develop resilience in the
        face of challenges.

      <h1>Who created Stoicism?</h1>
      <p>Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium, a Greek philosopher, around 300 BC in Athens, Greece. Zeno was
        influenced by earlier philosophers like Socrates, as well as the teachings of Cynicism. He established the Stoic
        school of philosophy, which gained popularity and became one of the most influential philosophical movements in
        ancient Greece and later in Rome.
        <br>

        The Stoic philosophy was further developed and refined by other notable philosophers such as Cleanthes,
        Chrysippus, and later, Seneca, Epictetus, and the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Throughout its history,
        Stoicism evolved and adapted, leaving a lasting impact on Western philosophy and ethics.

        This website will be focusing on Marcus Aurelius' impact on Stoicism solely, but we will provide links to other
        sites that also talk about other philosophical opinions on Stoicism and how it was impacted.
