      <p>Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that originated in Greece around the 3rd century BC. It teaches that the key
        to a good life is achieving inner tranquility and virtue by focusing on what we can control and accepting what
        we cannot."</p>

      <h1>Key principles of Stoicism</h1>
      
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> Focus on the present moment: Embrace the "here and now" and let go of anxieties about the past or the
        future.
        <br>

        <b>2.</b> Acceptance of the inevitable: Acknowledge that some things are beyond our control, and instead, focus
        on how we respond to them.
        <br>
        <b>3.</b> Virtue is the highest good: Strive to cultivate virtues such as wisdom, courage, justice, and
        temperance, as they lead to a fulfilling life.
        <br>
        <b>4.</b> Practice self-discipline: Train yourself to avoid impulsive reactions and develop resilience in the
        face of challenges.
