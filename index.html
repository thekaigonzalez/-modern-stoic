      <h1>What is Stoicism?</h1>
      <p>Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that originated in Greece around the 3rd century BC. It teaches that the key
        to a good life is achieving inner tranquility and virtue by focusing on what we can control and accepting what
        we cannot."</p>

      <h1>Key principles of Stoicism</h1>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> Focus on the present moment: Embrace the "here and now" and let go of anxieties about the past or the
        future.
        <br>

        <b>2.</b> Acceptance of the inevitable: Acknowledge that some things are beyond our control, and instead, focus
        on how we respond to them.
        <br>
        <b>3.</b> Virtue is the highest good: Strive to cultivate virtues such as wisdom, courage, justice, and
        temperance, as they lead to a fulfilling life.
        <br>
        <b>4.</b> Practice self-discipline: Train yourself to avoid impulsive reactions and develop resilience in the
        face of challenges.
        <br>
        <b>5.</b> Embrace setbacks as opportunities: View obstacles as chances for growth and learning, rather than as
        setbacks.
        <br>
        <b>6.</b> Cultivate gratitude: Appreciate what you have and be content with it, rather than constantly seeking
        more.
        <br>
        <b>7.</b> Practice mindfulness: Observe your thoughts and emotions without judgment to gain better control over
        your reactions.
